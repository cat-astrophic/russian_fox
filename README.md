# russian_fox

This project runs a DiD determining whether Republicans move their political stances in accordance with those espoused by Fox News.

### This project was completed by running the following scripts in order**
1. russian_fox_raw_tweets.py -- *collects tweets from members of congress*
2. russian_fox_parse_tweets.py -- *parses tweets from members of congress*
3. russian_fox_build_dataset.py -- *merges data sets*
4. russian_fox_manual_classification.py -- *aids in manual classification process*
5. russian_fox_twint.py -- *collects tweets relevant to study*
6. russian_fox.R -- *runs regressions and creates figures*

** russian_fox_manual_classification.py required reading and manually classifying tweets. The final data set reflects my personal interpretations of the tweets and may/may not be what the authors intended to convey.
